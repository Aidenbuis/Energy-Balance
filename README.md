# Energy Balance Sheet

This project is to help people become more conscious of their energy balance. What costs energy and what brings them energy. It is based on the ancient concept of Yin Yang. It is a simple application with two lists. One is the a list of what brings you energy (Yin) and one is a list of what costs you energy (Yang).

The project uses React as the front-end library, Tailwind for styling the components and Beautiful-DnD to reorder the lists.
